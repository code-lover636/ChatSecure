# Spam Classifier Web Application

This is a web application built using React and FastAPI that uses machine learning to classify spam messages. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text messages and get real-time classification results.

ChatSecure provides a solution to this problem by leveraging machine learning algorithms to classify any text or message as either spam or legitimate. By using natural language processing techniques, the application analyzes the content and characteristics of messages to accurately determine their nature. Users can quickly identify and separate spam messages, allowing them to focus on genuine communications and avoid potential security risks.
